# need to find out what a floating point number is, which is represented as base 2 (binary) fractions. For example:
# below gives a definition of the modulus symbol:
# How does % work?
# Another way to say it is, "X divided by Y with J remaining." For example, "100 divided by 16 with 4 remaining." The result of % is the J part, or the remaining part.
