# this one is like your scripts with argv.
# note that you give an asterisk arg, which is a lot like
# argv but for functions and has to go inside ().
# this 'unpacks' args, which we can just set in the (),
# which is demonstrated in print_two_again

# Function checklist:
# 1) Did you start your function definition with 'def'?
# 2) Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters?
# 3) Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?
# 4) Did you put your arguments after the parenthisis ( separated by commas?
# 5) Did you make each argument unique (meaning no diplicate names)?
# 6) Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?
# 7) Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less
# 8) Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?

# When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:
# 1) Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
# 2) Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
# 3) Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
# 4) Did you end the function call with a ) character?

# What does * in *args do?
# That tells Python to take all the arguments to the function and then put them in args as a list.
